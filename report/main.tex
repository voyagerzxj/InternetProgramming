    This report firstly introduces development significance of the development of electronic medical record system and related technology. Then the system design tasks and detailed design methods are analyzed according to the needs, and focuses on the database structure design, and the main function modules of the real and related functions. Finally, it summarizes the systemâ€™s functional characteristics, the existing problems, and the corresponding improvement program. This system mainly uses the current relatively popular in the JSP to develop, adopt suitable for small to medium sized projects the MySQL database.
